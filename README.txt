In order to implement a rotate and method i did it inside figure to maximize code reuse
i did it by simply creating a value for the direction that the figure was going to be drawn to 
and saving that direction
i also created a setter method for turtle that sets its orientation so i didnt have to do math when resetting
the turtle to the intial direction is way cleaner
